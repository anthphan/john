_This is the deployed version of the site I built. The original client site is no longer live._

## About the Project

This site was built for a client based on a custom Figma design. It was used for about a year before the client decided to explore creating their own version. It showcases my ability to turn a design into a clean, fully responsive website.

## Features

- Fully responsive design
- Clean layout and modern styling
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Mobile friendly adjustments
- Smooth scroll navigation
