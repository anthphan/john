                Sepr8 stands as a dedicated B2C platform, offering homeowners a
                confidential avenue to obtain precise valuation reports for
                their properties. In mid-2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, an
                overwhelming 90% of homeowners in North America were hesitant to
                permit real estate professionals entry into their homes. This
                cautious stance, while understandable for safety reasons, left
                homeowners in a challenging predicament. They found themselves
                in need of property valuations while navigating the complexities
                of staying safe during a global health crisis.

              <p>
                Within the real estate sector, numerous tools claim to provide
                estimated property values. However, a prevalent challenge lies
                in their accuracy, as they often fail to deliver precise
                valuations, leaving consumers with misleading information.

              <p>
                In our user research study, we conducted interviews with both
                divorcees and real estate agents to gain insights into their
                unique perspectives and needs regarding property appraisal
                applications. The findings illuminated a common challenge faced
                by both groups: the necessity for a comprehensive solution that
                facilitates fair and accurate property valuation in divorce
                settlements. Divorcees expressed frustration with the lack of
                transparency and objectivity in the appraisal process, often
                leading to disputes over property division. Similarly, real
                estate agents highlighted the inefficiencies and inconsistencies
                in existing appraisal tools, which hindered their ability to
                provide reliable guidance to clients navigating divorce
                proceedings.
                <br />
                <br />
                These insights underscored the urgent need for a specialized
                appraisal application tailored to the unique requirements of
                divorce settlements. Such a solution would not only ensure
                transparency and accuracy in property valuation but also
                streamline the appraisal process, alleviating stress and
                facilitating smoother negotiations for all parties involved.

                The initial phase involved establishing the brand identity. To
                shape the brand's personality and gauge the product's
                feasibility, I conducted extensive primary and secondary market
                research to comprehend user needs.
                <br />
                <br />
                The research uncovered a significant trend among the millennial
                demographic, indicating a preference for self-assessment tools
                over traditional professional services when evaluating their
                homes. Rather than engaging a professional for an in-person
                appraisal, this demographic favoured online tools offering quick
                estimates.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a result, the brand's tone of voice was crafted to reflect
                speed, efficiency, and professionalism. The final logo design
                embodies this ethos, featuring a minimalist yet impactful design
                with text set against a neutral to bright green backdrop,
                capturing the essence of the brand's identity.

            <div class="project__description-2">
              <p>
                Following the establishment of the brand, I engaged in
                collaborative discussions with stakeholders to delineate the
                website's requirements. Key elements included the capability to
                access a sample report, detailed process descriptions, and a
                clear articulation of the value proposition.
                <br /><br />
                The subsequent step involved crafting a wireframe to visualize
                the information hierarchy. Structured to prioritize the value
                proposition followed by product offerings, the wireframe adopted
                a streamlined one-page layout to ensure seamless navigation and
                prevent the need for page switching. This approach facilitated a
                natural scrolling experience, effectively meeting the
                stakeholders' requirements while enhancing user engagement.

                This project spanned six weeks, inclusive of one significant
                redesign iteration. The initial phase provided invaluable
                learning experiences for our team, elucidating the essential
                requirements for an automated system and prompting further
                refinement of the copy. Upon completion, the final product
                underwent rigorous testing, leveraging analytic tools such as
                HotJar and Google Analytics to gain insights into user behaviour
                and engagement metrics.
                <br /><br />
                To refine the effectiveness of the copy and images, a custom A/B
                testing tool was employed, enabling continuous experimentation
                with different versions of the website. Through this method, the
                site dynamically switched between variations every 24 hours,
                allowing us to gauge market response and identify which version
                drove higher sales.
                <br /><br />
                The A/B testing phase also played a pivotal role in determining
                the optimal pricing strategy for the product. With competition
                in the field relatively low, it was essential to understand how
                the market would react to different price points. By analyzing
                click-through rates across each version of the website, we
                gained valuable insights that informed the final pricing
                decision, ensuring alignment with market preferences and
                maximizing sales potential.
